Coding Challenge: Create Hyperlinks

Challenge:
Add hyperlinks to your web page. Create links to other web pages or external websites.

Instructions:
1. Open your code editor and create a new folder for this challenge. Name it "hyperlink-challenge."

2. Inside the "hyperlink-challenge" folder, create an HTML file named "index.html."

3. In "index.html," set up the basic HTML structure, including the following:
   - Document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>
   - Opening and closing <html> tags.
   - Opening and closing <head> tags.
   - A <title> element with the text "Hyperlink Challenge."
   - Opening and closing <body> tags.

4. Inside the <body> section, add the following elements:
   - Create at least two hyperlinks to other web pages or external websites.

5. Use the <a> (anchor) element to create the hyperlinks. Specify the "href" attribute with the URL of the web page or website you want to link to.

6. Optionally, use the "target" attribute set to "_blank" to open the links in a new tab or window.

7. Save your "index.html" file.

8. Now, open your "index.html" file in a web browser to see your completed web page with hyperlinks.

9. Once you're finished, compare your code to the provided "final" solution in the challenge description to ensure everything matches.
