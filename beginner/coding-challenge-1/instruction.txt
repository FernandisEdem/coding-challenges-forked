Coding Challenge: Create a Simple Web Page

Challenge:
Create a basic HTML web page with a title, heading, paragraph, and an image. Use proper HTML tags for structure.

Instructions:
1. Open your code editor and create a new folder for this challenge. Name it "simple-web-page."

2. Inside the "simple-web-page" folder, create an HTML file named "index.html."

3. In "index.html," set up the basic HTML structure, including the following:
   - Document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>
   - Opening and closing <html> tags.
   - Opening and closing <head> tags.
   - A <title> element with the text "My Simple Web Page."

   - A <h1> element with the text "Welcome to My Web Page."
   - A <p> element with a brief description of your web page.
   - An <img> element for an image. For the source (src) attribute, link to an image located in the "assets" folder of your project. Make sure the image is named "example.jpg."

5. Save your "index.html" file.

6. Locate an image of your choice and place it in a folder named "assets" within the "simple-web-page" directory.

7. Now, open your "index.html" file in a web browser to see your completed web page.
