Coding Challenge: Create a Contact Form

Challenge:
Design a simple contact form using HTML. Include fields for name, email, message, and a submit button.

Instructions:
1. Open your code editor and create a new folder for this challenge. Name it "contact-form-challenge."

2. Inside the "contact-form-challenge" folder, create an HTML file named "index.html."

3. In "index.html," set up the basic HTML structure, including the following:
   - Document type declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
   - Opening and closing `<html>` tags.
   - Opening and closing `<head>` tags.
   - A `<title>` element with the text "Contact Form Challenge."
   - Opening and closing `<body>` tags.

4. Inside the `<body>` section, add the following elements:
   - Create a `<form>` element with the `action` attribute set to "/submit" and the `method` attribute set to "POST."

5. Inside the form, create input fields for:
   - Name: Use an `<input>` element with `type="text"` and a unique `id` and `name` attribute. Set the `placeholder` attribute to "Name."

6. Email: Use an `<input>` element with `type="email"` and a unique `id` and `name` attribute. Set the `placeholder` attribute to "Email."

7. Message: Use a `<textarea>` element with a unique `id` and `name` attribute. Set the `placeholder` attribute to "Message."

8. Add a submit button to the form using a `<button>` element. Set the `type` attribute to "submit" and the text within the button as "Submit."

9. Save your "index.html" file.

10. Now, open your "index.html" file in a web browser to see your completed contact form.

11. Once you're finished, compare your code to the provided "final" solution in the challenge description to ensure everything matches.
